## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Here To The Stars is for people who want to know more about outer space and what's happening around us.

This application will use the [name of API] API. Below are the documentation and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: [Link goes here]
- API endpoint #1

  - List of data values used by the endpoint
- API endpoint #2
  - Description of endpoint
  - List of data values used by the endpoint

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

**Example:**
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`
