Created by Caleb Johnson and Xavier Campos.

## üöÄ Mission statement

Our application, Here To The Stars is for people who want to know more about outer space and what's happening around us. It allows users to hear knews about what goes on in the cosmos as well as what the world around us is up to. It is made for the people who want to know as much about the world and galaxy as possible.

## API & React Router

This application will use the [Na] API. Below are the documentati on and specific endpoints we intend to use and the front-end pages that will use them.

- Link to API documentation: [https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#main-content] - REQUIRES KEY ()


- Link to API documentation: [https://worldnewsapi.com] - REQUIRES KEY (323ed60da6954f5181a32c3f8da158f2)


- API endpoint #1
  - [Description of endpoint](https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod)
  - fetches image of stars and sky


- API endpoint #2
  - [Description of endpoint](https://api.worldnewsapi.com/top-news)
  - List of data values used by the endpoint


- API endpoint #3
  - Description of endpoint

[If your API requires an API key, say so here.]

**Example:**
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks
  - This will fetch an array of artwork objects
  - For each artwork, I want the `id`, `title`, and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/{id}
  - This will fetch a single artwork object
  - I will use the `id`, `title`, `short_description`, `medium_display`, `place_of_origin` and `image_id`
- https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={query}
  - This will fetch a list of artworks that relate to the search query
  - For each artwork, I will use the `id` and `title`

## üë©‚Äçüíª MVP User Stories & Frontend Routes

The application will feature the following frontend routes and core features:

* On the `/home` page, users can view world news and news about space 
* On the `/home` page, users can click on a news article, taking them to the entire article.

**Example:**

- On the `/artworks/:artworkId` page, users can view additional details for a single piece of art
- On the `/` page, users can search for artwork titles related to a search term.

## ü§î Stretch User Stories
